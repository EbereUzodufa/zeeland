					The list goes on, but this is just to capture a few of the wealthy Nigerians into the real estate industry.
				</p>
				<p>
					Whatever might have drawn their interest to this booming industry, it can’t be unconnected to the goldmine, massive ROI, bankability, stability, little physical presence and the predictable nature of the real estate industry. These of course, are what every rich man wants from an investment.
